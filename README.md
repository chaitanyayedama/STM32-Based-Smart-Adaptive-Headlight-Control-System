# STM32-Based-Smart-Adaptive-Headlight-Control-System
Designed an adaptive headlight system with automatic high and low beam control and PWM based brightness adjustment using STM32F411. Implemented sensor driven techniques for predict lighting for fog, low visibility, and varying light environments while ensuring backward compatibility for retrofitting with existing vehicles
